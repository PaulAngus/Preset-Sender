# Preset Sender project guidance

## UI and UX changes

- For new or substantially changed UI elements and interactions, consult current official Microsoft Fluent 2 and Windows app design guidance for the relevant pattern before implementing. Do not require the user to request this research each time.
- Apply the guidance to Avalonia using the application's existing theme and controls. Distinguish documented requirements from product choices, and record relevant primary-source links and any deliberate deviations in the applicable UX document.
- Keep dismissal controls separate from task actions. For a details pane, put a clearly labelled close control at the trailing edge of its header, keep it reachable while scrolling, support keyboard dismissal, and return focus to the originating content.
- Check readable labels, spacing, hierarchy, keyboard access, accessible names, and focus behavior. Inspect rendered results in light and dark themes at normal and supported narrow window sizes before completing a layout change.
- Use proportionate regression checks for changed interaction behavior; do not replace visual inspection with assertions that merely mirror control construction.
